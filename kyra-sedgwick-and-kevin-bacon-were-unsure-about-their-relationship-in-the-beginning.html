The pair has two children from their lengthy marriage: son Travis Bacon, born in June 1989, and daughter Sosie Bacon, born in March 1992. Sedgwick and Bacon’s love has inspired many people since the two have remained together through thick and thin. But where did it all begin? And what do they have to say about their relationship? Here’s a detailed chronology.</p><h2>Kyra Sedgwick and Kevin Bacon Had a Difficult Start</h2><p>In an interview with Conan O’Brien in August 2012, the Golden Globes winner discussed her marriage to Bacon. In doing so, she disclosed that her spouse, who is also an actor, was skeptical about their marriage. Despite her feelings, her spouse was the one who first showed interest in her and continued inviting her out to dinner.&nbsp;According to her, she first met Bacon while working on the 1987 film Lemon Sky.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kyra-Sedgwick-2.jpg alt="Kyra Sedgwick" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“Every night after work — he was known for being extremely pleasant and lovely — he would invite the whole team to dinner and ask who wanted to join. Except for me, the whole ensemble would answer yes, “She remembered. But she was the one person he ever wanted to say yes to. “Later on, he informed me that the only person he wanted to say yes to was me, and I never said yes,” she continued. After weeks of pursuing her, he finally got a date with her. And, as they say, the rest is history.</p><h2>Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick Had Two Children</h2><p>Bacon, who memorably portrayed Ren McCormack in the 1984 musical drama film Footloose, proposed to his wife a year after they met, and she enthusiastically accepted.&nbsp;The pair then got married in September 1988.&nbsp;They didn’t put off becoming parents for long, though, as they had their first child, son Travis, less than a year after their wedding.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kyra-Sedgwick-4.jpg alt="Kyra Sedgwick" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“The minute I had a kid, I was like, ‘God, I want to make sure there’s a decent environment here for him,'” Sedgwick said to Glamour in 2019. “[Kevin and I] are both individuals who are moved to action, and we like being a part of the process of giving back. It is our obligation.”</p><p>They had their second child, daughter Sosie, a few years later.</p><h2>The Couple Has Passed Several Marriage Tests</h2><p>Sedgwick and Bacon have experienced their ups and downs as professional performers, married partners, and parents. The two, on the other hand, have passed every exam that has come their way. Bacon remarked on The Tonight Show, starring Jimmy Fallon, in April 2021, that the quarantine period was the final test of his marriage to Sedgwick.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kyra-Sedgwick-3.jpg alt="Kyra Sedgwick" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>During this period, the couple discovered that they “sort of had to” separate from one other for things to run correctly. As a result, they split throughout the day and reconnected later for dinner. The actor said that, despite the unique approach, the pair loved the routine, which helped them create a better relationship.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiisqqRYsCmsMawoJyjXZa7pXnKnq2ipl2XrqS7zWaunqqVYsKvv9SrnGaZkqTCtXnToZyiql2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1w</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkyra-sedgwick-and-kevin-bacon-were-unsure-about-their-relationship-in-the-beginning.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkyra-sedgwick-and-kevin-bacon-were-unsure-about-their-relationship-in-the-beginning.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkyra-sedgwick-and-kevin-bacon-were-unsure-about-their-relationship-in-the-beginning.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkyra-sedgwick-and-kevin-bacon-were-unsure-about-their-relationship-in-the-beginning.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkyra-sedgwick-and-kevin-bacon-were-unsure-about-their-relationship-in-the-beginning.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkyra-sedgwick-and-kevin-bacon-were-unsure-about-their-relationship-in-the-beginning.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lindsay-price-curtis-stone-married-actress-celeb-chef-wed-in-spain.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lindsay-price-curtis-stone-married-actress-celeb-chef-wed-in-spain.html>Lindsay Price, Curtis Stone Married: Actress, Celeb Chef Wed in Spain</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./healthy-and-happy-cher-is-ready-to-perform-again-after-recovering-from-a-serious-illness.html>Healthy and Happy!Cher is Ready to Perform Again After Recovering From a Serious Illness</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./healthy-and-happy-cher-is-ready-to-perform-again-after-recovering-from-a-serious-illness.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
