However, despite their greatest efforts, there’s no denying that having wealthy roots has certainly helped them along the way. Here are 10 celebrities who were rich before being famous.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/186606080.jpg alt='Nylon Magazine Celebrates "America The Issue" With Lana Del Rey And Marvin Scott-Jarrett' width=641 height=454 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>10.

As a child, Sparks was raised in a New Jersey suburb and was even allowed to be homeschooled so that she could dedicate more of her time to singing.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Mark Makela/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/457633446.jpg alt='"Charles James: Beyond Fashion" Costume Institute Gala - Candids' width=635 height=453 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal</strong></p><p>Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal are one of Hollywood’s famous pair of siblings. &nbsp;Although they have both earned substantial wealth throughout their careers, the two were actually very well-off long before either landed their first gig. &nbsp;Their parents, Stephen Gyllenhaal, a director, and Naomi Foner a screenwriter,&nbsp;have achieved great success in the entertainment industry, and have shared their wealth with their children.</p><p>(Photo by Andrew H.

Since gaining fame, Jones has proven that her talents extend far beyond the front of a camera.&nbsp;Over the course of her career, Jones has worked hard to establish her own career to avoid living in the shadow of her famous father, Quincy Jones’ success. &nbsp;With a record number of Grammy nominations (79) Quincy Jones is one of the most successful people in recent music history, and as a result has built a multi-million dollar empire.</p><p>(Photo by Frederick M.
