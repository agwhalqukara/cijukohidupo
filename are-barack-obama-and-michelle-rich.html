Ever since then, they’ve been in the public eye–and with all of the publicity that they get, it’s natural to wonder how much the Obamas make.</p><p><strong>Barack and Michelle Obama are now rich but have not always been. With Michelle’s work as a lawyer, Barack’s as a politician, and now both of them working as authors and public figures, they’ve become rich, and their net worth is now around 70 million dollars.</strong></p><p>Read on to find out more about Barack and Michelle Obama’s situation and how they’ve been making their money.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jobs Past and Present</h2><p>To be <a href=# rel=noopener>considered rich</a>, someone must have a net worth between 2.2 and 2.6 million dollars, according to the generation–<a href=# rel=noopener>Baby Boomers</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Generation X</a> are on the higher side of that range, both at $2.6 million, while Millennials are at $2.2 million. On average, many agree that having a net worth $2.3 million is the baseline for being rich.</p><p>In 2008, when the Obamas were moving into the White House after winning the presidential election, their net worth was about $1.3 million. While they were above the average net worth for American households, they were not considered rich.</p><p>Before becoming a politician, Obama was an author and a lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, teaching constitutional law. Michelle Obama worked in marketing and intellectual property law at the law firm <a href=# rel=noopener>Sidley & Austin</a> in Chicago, which is how she met Barack.</p><p>While Michelle Obama was the primary earner when Barack was a senator for Illinois, they switched roles for a time with the presidency, Barack focusing more on his work and Michelle spending more time with their daughters and on the campaign trail.</p><p>When Barack Obama was in office, the family <a href=# rel=noopener>made</a> about 20 million over those eight years. Obama made about 8.8 million dollars from his books, <a href=# rel=noopener>The Audacity of Hope</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Of Thee I Sing: A Letter To My Daughters</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Dreams From My Father</a>, Obama’s memoir that was originally published in 1995, also sold a great deal with his election in 2008 and made about 6.8 million dollars. His presidential salary may have declined over the years, but he made a total of 3.1 million dollars in his time as president, and like all other presidents, receives a <a href=# rel=noopener>pension</a> of about 200,000 dollars a year since the end of his presidency.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Recent Book Deals and Events</h2><p>After Obama’s presidency, he and Michelle both signed book deals worth about 60 million dollars, and Michelle Obama’s bestselling memoir <a href=# rel=noopener>Becoming</a> has sold over 10 million copies and has sold <a href=# rel=noopener>more</a> copies than any other book published in the United States.</p><p>The couple also took a 50 million dollar deal with Netflix after making the documentary version of Michelle’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Becoming</a>.</p><p>Reader and viewer reactions to Becoming were very positive, and fans took to social media to praise them, posting things like <a href=# rel=noopener>this</a> about the documentary, writing that “[h]er humility, dignity, love and intelligence shine through,” or like <a href=# rel=noopener>this</a> about the book, the fan calling it “[o]ne of [her] favorite books that [she] has read in the last year.”</p><p>As public figures, both Barack and Michelle Obama are paid to give talks and speeches to various audiences, which is another way that they’ve reached their current combined <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> of 70 million dollars.</p><p>The Obamas <a href=# rel=noopener>donate</a> some of their money to different charities, especially from the proceeds they make from their books. They’re also paying for their daughters’ educations–Malia, who is going to <a href=# rel=noopener>Harvard</a>, and Sasha, who is going to the <a href=# rel=noopener>University of Michigan</a>.</p><p>Check out the YouTube video below to watch the trailer for the Netflix documentary on Michelle Obama’s life, Becoming.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jpqpnmWSlr%2Bir8pmpKKbmJq5rbGMqJmapZFiv6qvx2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-barack-obama-and-michelle-rich.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fare-barack-obama-and-michelle-rich.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fare-barack-obama-and-michelle-rich.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fare-barack-obama-and-michelle-rich.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-barack-obama-and-michelle-rich.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-barack-obama-and-michelle-rich.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./college-football-playoff-projections-week-14-rankings-and-bowl-forecast-news-scores-highlights.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./college-football-playoff-projections-week-14-rankings-and-bowl-forecast-news-scores-highlights.html>College Football Playoff Projections: Week 14 Rankings and Bowl Forecast | News, Scores, Highlights,</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nick-offerman-wiki-age-height-wife-kids-net-worth-ethnicity.html>Nick Offerman- Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, Kids, Net Worth, Ethnicity</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nick-offerman-wiki-age-height-wife-kids-net-worth-ethnicity.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
