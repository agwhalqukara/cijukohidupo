She was born under the zodiac sign Aries on 3 April 2007. There is no public information on the <a href=#>school</a> she attends, but she is believed to be in a high school in California.</p><h3>Angel Iris Murphy Brown's parents</h3><p class=align-left>Angel's father, Edward Regan Murphy, is a famous actor, voice actor, comedian, singer, producer, and entrepreneur. He was born on 3 April 1961 in Brooklyn, New York, and has received several awards for his outstanding career since the 1980s, like the Cecil B. DeMille Award 2023.</p><p class=align-left>The Grammy award winner has appeared and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">worked in movies</a> and <a href=#>TV shows</a> like <i>Saturday Night Live, Dreamgirls, </i>and<i> Shrek 2</i>. He is the first actor to receive $1,000,000 for his first film and a BAFTA nomination for a voice-over performance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/47e7f14950e1bc32.jpg><p class=align-left>Melanie Janine Brown, Angel's mother, also known as Mel B, is a British celebrity born on 29 May 1975. She is a singer, songwriter, actress, and TV personality. Mel B gained popularity in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls, a group that became the best-selling female group of all time, with over 100 million records sold worldwide.</p><p class=align-left>She has released several songs, including <i>Hot </i>and<i> I Want You Back.</i> Some of Mel B's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">movies and TV shows</a> include <i>Spice <a href=#>World</a>, America's Got Talent: The Champions, </i>and<i> The X Factor UK.</i></p><h2>Does Eddie Murphy claim Mel B's daughter?</h2><p class=align-left>Yes, he does, though he initially denied her paternity. After the lovebirds <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met in 2006 </a>in Beverly Hills and started dating following Eddie's divorce from his first wife, Nicole, he claimed he did not know the child's father. He also insisted that a blood test after birth should confirm for him.</p><p class=align-left>This caused significant distress for Mel B, who insisted the pregnancy was planned. Murphy later apologised for his comments and regretted his actions, and a DNA test <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">confirmed Murphy's paternity</a> on 22 June 2007. Angel Iris Murphy Brown and Eddie Murphy's relationship was strained during her childhood, but they reconciled in 2017 and have since become close.</p><h2>How many kids does Mel B have, and to who?</h2><p class=align-left>Mel B has three children; two daughters are from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">different marriages</a>, and the third child is with Eddie Murphy.

He had his first child, Eric Murphy, in 1989 with Paulette McNeely. He then had five children: Bria, Myles Mitchell, Shayne Audra, Zola Ivy, and Bella Zahra Murphy, with his ex-wife Nicole Murphy, whom he married between 1993 and 2006.</p><p class=align-left>The actor also has a son, Christian, from his former girlfriend, Tamara Hood. He had Angel from Mel B and two children named Izzy Oona, and Max Charles Murphy, from his current fiancee Paige Butcher.</p><h2>How much does Mel B get from Eddie Murphy?</h2><p class=align-left>In 2009, a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">court ordered Eddie</a> to pay Mel B $25,000 monthly as child support, covering health insurance and educational expenses. Mel B filed for an increase due to a declining income.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/a02ae4e48c417a18.jpg><p class=align-left>So, he was ordered to pay $35,000 in child support from October 2021 until Angel turns 18 in 2025, with the extra $10,000 going toward supporting the child and Mel B's attorney fees.</p><h2>Why did Eddie Murphy retire?</h2><p class=align-left>After witnessing some flops, he took a break from acting, which earned him Golden Raspberry Awards. While speaking during Marc Maron’s podcast in 2021, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he said</a>:</p>I had stopped making movies in 2011 because I was making these crappy movies....They giving me Razzies; I think these [contemptible people] gave me the Worst Actor Ever Razzie.<h2>Net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Angel has no net worth, but her father, Murphy, is estimated to have a net worth of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$200 million</a>.
