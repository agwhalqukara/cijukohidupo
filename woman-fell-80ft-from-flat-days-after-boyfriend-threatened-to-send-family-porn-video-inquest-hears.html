class=mol-para-with-font>The responding officers were later criticised for spending around 40 minutes chatting to him in his apartment.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They only arrived at Ms Jussipaliyeva’s home nearby at around 1.30am – ten minutes after she plunged to her death.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bianchi and Damilya had been in an on-off relationship for two-and-a-half years before her death.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She told police there had been a row at his flat on May 12 and he had ‘grabbed her by the throat, struck her four or five times, spat on her and that she had passed out for a few seconds’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The couple’s friends at Regent’s University in London were aware of their tumultuous relationship and Bianchi had reported her to police himself on several occasions, when she had scratched him and she had attempted suicide.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was sent a video recording on WhatsApp of her performing oral

requirement and made to pay £250 costs</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When Bianchi’s phone was seized by police on June 1 they found WhatsApp messages in which he had asked his friend to send the video to Ms Jussipaliyeva.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She reported the sending of the revenge porn to police but continued the relationship afterwards.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Jussipaliyeva told police she did not know she was being recorded in the phone booth.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: ‘I found it really insulting and humiliating, I think he’s doing this for revenge because of the argument.&nbsp;I am still in shock and feel broken.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said she was ‘very scared mentally and physically’ because Bianchi had threatened to send the porn, as well as footage of her taking cocaine, to her family.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On June 1 the pair went out drinking with friends, arriving back at Bianchi’s apartment at around 11.30pm.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They had an argument before Bianchi pushed Ms Jussipaliyeva into the water feature in front of the building.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The violence outside the building lasted for over half an hour before the concierge called police in the early hours of June 2.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bianchi, born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was arrested and had his phone seized.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The next day he received distraught text messages, similar to those he said he had received in the past, from Ms Jussipaliyeva.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He called police and rushed to her apartment in South Wharf Road, Paddington, but found her dead on the ground. She had left a note which read: ‘Alessio I love you, sorry.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bianchi was born in Jeddah where his father worked and moved to London in 2009 to study at Regent’s University.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Giving evidence at Inner West London Coroner’s Court today via videolink from Dubai her sister Ainel Jussipaliyeva said: ‘She was a very cheerful and happy person.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘She had lots of friends. She was a very sociable person. She was like the sunshine in our family. She had never thought about finishing her life.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Jussipaliyeva said her sister planned to finish her business studies course and become a make-up artist.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Coroner Bernard Richmond, QC, said: ‘We know you and your family are very angry with Mr Bianchi?’ Ms Jussipaliyeva replied: ‘Right.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said a couple of months before she died Ms Jussipaliyeva came to visit her in Dubai after she broke up with Bianchi.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘She was actually scared of him because he was either drunk or on drugs.’ Bianchi had turned up at Damilya’s apartment and trashed it during their ‘toxic’ relationship, the inquest heard.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said her sister had ‘lots of friends’ after she came to London but this changed during her relationship with Bianchi.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: ‘For the first two years in London while she didn’t have those relationships… she was going out doing lots of things.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Once they started to date they were spending 24 hours together. She started to ignore them [her friends]. She was changing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘She started to argue with all of us, with my parents, with me. No one could recognise her.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Asked if her family had been pressuring Ms Jussipaliyeva to end the relationship, she said: ‘No one was pressuring Damilya. We were just trying to explain to her.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We suspected she was taking drugs because at times her behaviour was different and I knew that Bianchi was taking drugs because she told me.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘To be honest for the last half a year everyone was just trying to be patient and wait for the moment when she is going to like finally come to the point that she needs to break up.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We wanted her to decide, no one wanted to decide instead of her. He ruined our relationships, my relationship with my sister. He was manipulative.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The inquest was told the Jussipalenya sisters’ maternal uncle had taken his own life and Ms Jussipaliyeva had been going to therapy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Alexandra Felix, for Bianchi, asked: ‘Were you aware before this of Damilya trying to take her own life prior to this incident in June?’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Jussipalenya replied: ‘No.’&nbsp;On 21 May 2017 Ms Jussipaliyeva had an argument with her sister after she found out she was back with Bianchi.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The coroner asked Ms Jussipaliyeva if she was aware of the sex video involving her sister. Ms Jussipaliyeva said: ‘I found out after her death.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The coroner suggested their culture meant Ms Jussipaliyeva had been ‘raised with very puritan traditions’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Jussipaliyeva said: ‘I knew about her sexual life my parents were not just asking because they are parents.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The coroner asked: ‘From a traditional Muslim background the sexual relationship itself was shameful?’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Jussipaliyeva said: ‘We are Muslim but we don’t practice the religion. It’s not that… strict to have the sexual life only after the marriage.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The coroner confirmed Ms Jussipaliyeva’s injuries were consistent with a fall from a great height.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said there were ‘no injuries, indicative of assault or restraint by a third party’. The coroner said there was low level of alcohol and the sedative Alprazolam in her blood.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Jussipalenya’s family, from Kazakhstan, earlier said in a statement: ‘We cannot describe the pain we feel of losing our beloved Damilya.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘She was such an adorable, wonderful, loving, caring and intelligent girl. She loves everyone with all of her heart and tried to see the good in everyone she encountered.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We are heartbroken to hear the details of the abuse and torment in which our daughter had to endure because of Mr Bianchi.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘She had a bright future ahead of her and had so many dreams and aspirations to accomplish great things.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘While we mourn the loss of a very good girl, we also celebrate her remarkable life and hope that the memory will live on in all that know her.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The inquest continues tomorrow, with Bianchi due to give evidence via videolink.</p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li class=class><span class=mol-style-bold><span class=mol-style-italic>For confidential support, call the Samaritans on 116123, or visit their local branch</span></span></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnp6S6orqMn5ylpF1tfafAjJ%2BpqKVdm7miwIydmLKrXZaztbHRZpmosZantqa6w2aroaqVlsGmusSdZK2nXaiyr7CMn5imoZyuerG70adkr6GUmrxutc2qrJ6rpGK1pq3RrGY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwoman-fell-80ft-from-flat-days-after-boyfriend-threatened-to-send-family-porn-video-inquest-hears.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwoman-fell-80ft-from-flat-days-after-boyfriend-threatened-to-send-family-porn-video-inquest-hears.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwoman-fell-80ft-from-flat-days-after-boyfriend-threatened-to-send-family-porn-video-inquest-hears.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwoman-fell-80ft-from-flat-days-after-boyfriend-threatened-to-send-family-porn-video-inquest-hears.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwoman-fell-80ft-from-flat-days-after-boyfriend-threatened-to-send-family-porn-video-inquest-hears.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwoman-fell-80ft-from-flat-days-after-boyfriend-threatened-to-send-family-porn-video-inquest-hears.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1-trade-idea-for-every-team-watching-the-stanley-cup-final-news-scores-highlights-stats-and-ru.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1-trade-idea-for-every-team-watching-the-stanley-cup-final-news-scores-highlights-stats-and-ru.html>1 Trade Idea for Every Team Watching the Stanley Cup Final | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Ru</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./when-mother-s-day-is.html>When Mother's Day is</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./when-mother-s-day-is.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
