<time>05 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Kamaru Usman</strong> is a Nigerian-born American professional MMA(mixed martial artist). He was born in this world on the 11th of May 1987 to a middle-class family in a small town called Auchi.</p><p>After spending eight years of his life in average living conditions, his father brought him and his entire family to the US.</p><p>However, things didn’t become smooth so quickly. As a kid with poor English and black descent, Usman’s fellow classmen often teased and bullied him. He used to play football during his sophomore year.</p><p>Still, a significant injury led him to find an alternative path in wrestling and, later down the road, a career in MMA.</p><p>Both MMA and wrestling came to him in the same way, and he had eventually blown up without his knowledge.</p><h2>Kamaru is Married to His Wife Eleslie Dietzsch</h2><p><a href=#>Kamaru Usman</a> has been married to Eleslie Dietzsch for over a few years now. After dating her in 2012, they have been on a steady path in their relationship.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-3278 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritygen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kamaru-USMAN-Eleslie-Dietzsch.jpg alt="Image of professional MMA(mixed martial artist), Kamaru USMAN and his wife" width=564 height=492 sizes="(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-3278 class=wp-caption-text>A professional MMA(mixed martial artist), Kamaru USMAN, and his wife, Eleslie Dietzsch.</p><p>In an interview back in 2016, he revealed that Eleslie was his girlfriend, and now, in 2021, they tied the knot and have a beautiful daughter aged 7.</p><p>Being an incredibly private person, he hasn’t shared much of his love life in the masses. But rest assured, the two seem to have a very fulfilling life with each other.</p><h2>Who is Kamaru Usman Wife Eleslie Dietzsch?</h2><p>Kamaru Usman’s baby momma and wife Eleslie Dietzsch has not much written about her. Even as the wife, she has no feature on her husband’s wiki.</p><p>However, we can tell you that Eleslie is of Portuguese nationality and Brazilian descent.</p><p>She is five years older than Usman, making her 38 years old in 2021, and celebrates her birthday on the 23rd of November 1986.</p><p>Additionally, Eleslie seems to have two sisters and her father and mother altogether in her side of the family.</p><h2>Eleslie Dietzsch Social Media Activities</h2><p>Eleslie Dietzsch is available on <a href=#>Instagram</a> with a following of 1009 as of today. Alongside this, she also runs her daughter’s Instagram with her husband and posts pictures of the family doing various activities.</p><p>She actively posts on her Instagram account as well. The latest post is on the 11th of June as I am writing this article.</p><p>Her Instagram bio states,</p><p>“Her vibe was completely her own…</p><p>…She reminded me of no one.”</p><h2>Samirah Usman: Daughter of Kamaru Usman</h2><p>Unlike her mother and father, baby Samirah likes to enjoy her spotlight. Born in 2014, she is the only daughter of Kamaru and Eleslie.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-3277 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritygen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/kamaru-with-his-wife-and-daughter.jpg alt="Image of professional MMA(mixed martial artist), Kamaru USMAN and his family" width=560 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-3277 class=wp-caption-text>A renowned MMA(mixed martial artist), Kamaru USMAN, and his wife, Eleslie Dietzsch and his daughter, Samirah.</p><p>Samirah is a beautiful little lady who loves spending time with her parents and shares a great bond with them. We can often see her attending her father’s games like a lovely daughter.</p><p>Due to the bond they share, Samirah often shows up on her father’s and mother’s Instagram, and we can see her having a great time. She even has her own <a href=#>Instagram</a> and a self-named <a href=#>YouTube</a> channel with about 186 subscribers.</p><p>From what we already know, the Usman family enjoys each other’s company, and we hope it stays the same way in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCgnZ5jsLC5jqSYppmiqnq2v8yapWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-kamaru-usman-wife-eleslie-dietzsch-and-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeet-kamaru-usman-wife-eleslie-dietzsch-and-daughter.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeet-kamaru-usman-wife-eleslie-dietzsch-and-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeet-kamaru-usman-wife-eleslie-dietzsch-and-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-kamaru-usman-wife-eleslie-dietzsch-and-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-kamaru-usman-wife-eleslie-dietzsch-and-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./paul-gilbert-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./paul-gilbert-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html>Paul Gilbert Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./diem-brown-s-love-chris-ct-tamburello-proposed-on-her-deathbed.html>Diem Brown's Love Chris &amp;quot;CT&amp;quot; Tamburello Proposed on Her Deathbed</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./diem-brown-s-love-chris-ct-tamburello-proposed-on-her-deathbed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
