Yep, the fashion designer began to hit it big in the fashion industry after she established a shoe company, Julia Haart, in 2013.</p><p>While most of her wealth can be traced to her successful business empire, her contract with Netflix and royalties from her book sales indeed pitched in parts of <strong>her stunning net worth</strong>, too!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>When Did Julia Haart Begin Her Career?</h3><p>Born in USSR-era Moscow, Julia Haart’s life is one of the notable immigrant success stories. When she was three, Julia moved to Austin with her parents before eventually moving to Monsey, New York.</p><p class=related-post>Read Also: <a href=#>The Truth About Joe Gatto’s Net Worth and How Impractical Jokers Skyrocketed His Career</a></p><p>Before entering the fashion industry, Julia joined the Haredi community, a strict branch of Orthodox Judaism. She worked as a teacher at Yeshiva Atlanta. After leaving the community, Julia later entered the fashion industry, founding a shoe company named after herself in 2013.</p><p>Three years later, she collaborated with the luxury brand La Perla for the 2016 Spring/Fall collection. Later that year, Julia was appointed as the brand’s creative director. In 2019, Julia became the CEO of the talent company Elite World Group.</p><p>Two of those positions were credited to Silvio Scaglia’s nomination, who happened to be La Perla’s former president and Julia’s future husband.</p><p>Shortly after joining Elite World Group as the CEO, she became the creative director of e1972, a luxury brand launched by Elite World Group.</p><p>Unfortunately, following her separation from Silvio, the former couple had difficulties keeping things professional as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Silvio fired Julia</a> from her role as CEO. Of course, you can’t cite divorce as the reason, so Silvio accused her of company embezzlement!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/creeto.com/wp-content/uploads/Julia-Haart-in-My-Unorthodox-Life.jpg><p>In 2021, Julia Haart became the subject of Netflix’s miniseries, <a href=# rel=noopener>My Unorthodox Life</a>.

The three-story apartment boasts 10,000 square feet of living space for Julia and her family. The property cost Julia and her ex-husband Silvio Scaglia a jaw-dropping $65 million!</p><p>Besides her New York penthouse, Julia owns <a href=# rel=noopener>a property in The Hamptons</a>. With how the property seems less dazzling than her New York estate, it’s possible that she mainly stays there to wind down from the hustle and buzz of the Big Apple!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/creeto.com/wp-content/uploads/Julia-Haart-house-in-The-Hamptons.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What Car Does Julia Haart Drive?</h3><p>If celebrities with humble net worth can collect multiple expensive cars, then you best bet that Julia Haart can own so much more!

Silvio claimed that the Bentley solely belonged to the Elite World Group as a company, thus demanding Julia return the expensive car immediately.</p><p>On the other hand, Julia’s representative insisted that Julia paid half of the lease with her own money, which means that the car belongs to her as she’s the co-owner of Elite World Group.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What Other Businesses Does Julia Haart Own?</h3><p>Following her messy divorce from Silvio Scaglia and her subsequent abrupt firing, <strong>Julia Haart</strong> started two new businesses in different fields!
